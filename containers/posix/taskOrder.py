# A sequence determining the order of tasks in the packing.

####
####  TODO: Why do the tests only run when mm0 precedes fs0 in the load list?
####

# NB test0 cannot be the first task in the list because of the processing of test_exec_linker.lds.in.

#taskOrder = ('mm0', 'fs0', 'test0')#  Works fine.
#taskOrder = ('fs0', 'mm0', 'test0')#  Compiles, loads and executes fine, but does not execute the tests.
#taskOrder = ('fs0', 'test0', 'mm0')#  Compiles, loads and executes fine, but does not execute the tests.
taskOrder = ('mm0', 'test0', 'fs0')#  Works fine.
